[TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org/) is a new and sweet package out of Google for Deep Learning.

There has been a lot of talk on github about how to get it to run on AWS. I just went through the hassle today and in the interest of not having others endure the same, here's an AMI ID on AWS with it built and ready to go: ami-03512969[^1].

[^1]: It looks like [erikbern](https://gist.github.com/erikbern) also posted his solution on github. He included the install script as well. You can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/erikbern/78ba519b97b440e10640).
